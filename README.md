1. [Interactive map](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/Leaflet_Map): Leaflet showing Michelin Restaurants in Singapore.

2. [Heart Disease Calculator](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/ShinyApps/Heart_Disease_Predictor): Calculates the probability of having Coronary Heart Disease based on five variables. Just change the five slider values and see the probability value changes correspondingly

3. [Next Word Predictor](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/ShinyApps/NextWordPredictor): Type in at least 3 words and this app will predict the next word for you, alongside the scores of each prediction, and the ngram from which the prediction came. 

4. [Tweetbot](https://github.com/qwyeow/JHU_DataScience/tree/master/ShinyApps/Tweetbot): Somehow this tweetbot, a project I created for fun, made it to Prof. Michael Kearney's list of shinyapps that have been shared on twitter.
